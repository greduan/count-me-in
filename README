count-me-in
===========

Gittip: https://www.gittip.com/Greduan/

This project may only be useful to me, but I'm sharing it because it may be
useful to someone else.

Basically it's a counter.  You call it, give it a file and it adds a number to
whatever the number on that file is.  I usually count stuff by hand on a piece
of paper, but sometimes I don't have that and I still need to count stuff, so
I'm making this.

It has one counter per file, I'll probably make it fancy and add stuff where it
keeps track of the date when that was counted, be able to count more than one
digit at a time, list the total count nicely, etc.


Installation
------------

You can get the latest stable and/or development version from the GitHub
repo. <https://github.com/Greduan/count-me-in>

To install simply clone this repo somewhere and add an alias to your shell that
points to the location of this repo's `bin/cmi`.  Something like this:

    alias cmi='/home/greduan/dev/count-me-in/bin/cmi'

Of course replacing that with your actual location.  Can be an absolute path or
not, your preference, but I'm not exactly sure what would and wouldn't work for
this, so figure it out.
