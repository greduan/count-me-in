## 0.4.0 - Unreleased

### Added

  - `main.newNumber(num, num, bool)` (along with passing tests)
  - `main.newLine(num)`
- The `bin/cmi` file which would be the main command provided by this module.

### Changed

- `index.js` file now returns the `lib/main.js` file.
- Updates to README.md.  Including updated install instructions.  Now uses
  `npm link` instead of a shell alias.

## v0.0.0 to v0.3.0

Previous versions.  No incompatible change but the code was re-written so these
versions don't matter.  They also don't matter because this is a tiny app, not a
library of any sort.
